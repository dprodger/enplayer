enplayer
========

Spotify App that creates a playlist from a list of EN Song IDs

Installation
============

1. ensure you have a ~/Spotify directory
2. clone this repo into ~/Spotify/enplayer
3. edit index.html to put in your own EN ID
4. Open Spotify
5. Navigate to spotify:app:enplayer

Notes
=====

1. The input form is crazy-unforgiving. Each line must have something that starts with SO but I am not checking its validity beyond that. It's easy to confuse
2. I'd like to update the display of the playlist that is generated to be a better, more helpful format.
3. I'm not sure that it all works correctly if you do it over & over
4. Playlist naming -- if I reuse a name it should confirm overwriting, not create a new one.
